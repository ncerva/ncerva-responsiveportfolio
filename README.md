# Responsive Design: Portfolio

This project is the beginning of my professional portfolio. It showcases some work that I have done as a graphic designer. 

The html is coded using semantically correct code as well as correctly linking links to appropriate content. (View the index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html files) 

The page also utilizes the navbar from Bootstrap as well as the grid system.
